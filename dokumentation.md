Project Portfolio

What is this project about?
- So, the project is about making personal portfolio that holds my most interesting projects. Also shows my experience and contact information.

Main features that i want to include in my portfolio are:

1. Pages for introduction(home), experience that has my "career", projectlist that holds my projects and lastly individual project display.
2. Minor animations that make the user experience better. Not too much so it would not cost performance.
3. Include footer and navbar
