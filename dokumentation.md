Project Portfolio

What is this project about?
- So, the project is about making personal portfolio that holds my most interesting projects. Also shows my experience and contact information.

Main features that i want to include in my portfolio are:

1. Pages for introduction(home), experience that has my "career", projectlist that holds my projects and lastly individual project display.
2. Minor animations that make the user experience better. Not too much so it would not cost performance.
3. Include footer and navbar

Used technologies:

- ReactJS 
- SCSS includes flex and grid. 
- Boostrap mostly used in social icons.
- Git and Visual Studio Code
- Github Pages to display it to the web insted of localhost

How many hours did this project took me?
- Making this portfolio took me about 40h? This includes research on projects techologies.


What did i learn?
- Learned to use scss insted of css. The only difference is that you can use mixin and nest classes etc. CSS is getting the nesting feature so i would just use it honestly.
- Making good plan before starting to code is a must. If not then time just run for nothing, because you are just wondering what to implement.
- Using ReactJS is much easier to in my opinion. Takes less time to make websites using react.


What would i do better?
- Try to learn how to use tailwindcss
- Learn to make own logo and animate it
- Make better plan from the start to know what i am making



Conclusions:
- I am very pround that i made this project that will help me in the future.
- Definetly going to use more reactjs than vanilla css/html
- Framer-motion library would be my next research idea
